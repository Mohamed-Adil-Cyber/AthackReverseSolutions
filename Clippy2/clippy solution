Firstly we check what linkers does the exe have to see if we can decompile the code
https://github.com/Mohamed-Adil-Cyber/AthackReverseSolutions/blob/main/Clippy2/images/Screenshot_1.jpg
we see that it has a dot net linker meaning that we can compile it back to c# and visual basic 
we use dns spy to decompile the code
we see that its taking its input from the clipboard and placing it inside a function
to simplify what the function is doing an array named array is created and the xor of first and second character in our input is compared to the second cahracter in the array
then the xor of the third
