We open the binary on radare to see it ass assembly using VVV option on radare

we see that it immediatly jumps to 4d at the begining so we go and check what is happening there

we see that rdx points to a location in the file then takes whatever its ponting to up to 8 bytes and stores it in eax then points to a location after 20 (32) hex characters and takes 8 bytes and xor it to the first 8 bytes, rbx is then subtracted and the process is looped a number of times and the program ends.

so to simplify it choses a space that has 64 bytes and takes the first 32 byte and xors it with the last 32 byte

we go back to the beginning of the code and notice that everything starting from D to 4D is not used which is exactly 64 


Cyber/AthackReverseSolutions/blob/main/Clippy2/images/Screenshot_1.jpg)
we take the first 32 bytes


Cyber/AthackReverseSolutions/blob/main/Clippy2/images/Screenshot_1.jpg)
and the last 32 bytes


Cyber/AthackReverseSolutions/blob/main/Clippy2/images/Screenshot_1.jpg)
and xor them together

then convert to ascii and we got the flag which is AtHackCTF{FF00CEC3E746AA7F00FF0}
